      <description>Who I Am Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Patrick Aikens.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, and have been for a very long time. I started in the video games industry. Since then I have passed through the insurance industry and the banking industry before ending up at Manheim, Inc. where I remain today.
My Blog This blog is built with Hugo, a great static website generator written in Go. I&amp;rsquo;m using the hugo-dusk theme.</description>
